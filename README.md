# TriviaGame
A trivia game that populates one question at a time.
I tried to generate all of the content dynamically through Javascript/ jQuery. 
Was successful in some areas, not so much in others.

Simple trivia game. 10 questions, 30 seconds per question.
Calculates the total of correct/ incorrect answers and displays the total at the end of the game.
The restart button DOES restart the game, I just can't figure out why the actual questions aren't showing up...
Added alerts for correct answers, wrong answers, and time-outs.
Could not figure out how to get the associated images to display, and continue to the next question.
